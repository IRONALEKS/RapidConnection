# RapidConnection
RapidConnection is a lightweight library that is written tottaly in Java without any dependency on other libraries

It is made to send small or large messages across a tcp connection at a very fast rate

The documentation is in my taste well written, hope it will be useful to you :D

On mu laptop the speed is from 1800000 to 2500000 messages per second

Tested on ip:localhost port:25565

Each message is roughly 10 bytes
